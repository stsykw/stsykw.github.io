Mathjax bug?
==========
The following inline math is written as 'A=a, b=B':  \\(A = a, b=B\\)     
But the CHTML renderer working in Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer on Win 10 rendered as "A=A, b=b". The SVG renderer works fine.
Which is this a bug of Mathjax or Microsoft?  

(The default renderer in this page is SVG. The renderer can be selected by right click on the math expression.)
