Mathjax bug?
==========
The following inline math is written as 'A=a':  \\(A = a\\)
But the CHTML renderer working in Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer on Win 10 rendered as "A=A". The SVG renderer works fine.
Which is this a bug of Mathjax or Microsoft?  

(The default renderer in this page is SVG.)
